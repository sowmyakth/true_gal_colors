This README file describes the AEGIS F814W<25.2 training sample, which is a
random(fair) subsample of all galaxies in the AEGIS field in
F606w and F814W bands.

NOTE: The fields in the catalog are those expected by galsim.RealGalaxyCatalog.
However, some parts of the analysis were not performed(e.g. parametric fits).
Hence those values were manually set, and do not have physical meaning.

(1) The catalogs themselves are in AEGIS_galaxy_catalog_[VI]_25.2.fits (where
[VI] indicates either V or I).  These files can be used to initialize a
galsim.RealGalaxyCatalog or galsim.COSMOSCatalog instance, and contain a FITS
tables that could also be  read in directly using, e.g., python or IDL.  The
fields that are included for each galaxy are:

IDENT: AEGIS object identifier. This value is internally derived.  Therefore
do not rely on this IDENT for cross-matching between other AEGIS catalogs.

RA, DEC: Right ascension and declination (J2000, degrees).  While this is not
needed for image simulation, it is necessary for proper cross-matching with
other catalogs.

MAG: magnitude (MAG_AUTO calculated from sextractor).

BAND: Passband for the observed image (F814W/F606W).

WEIGHT: A weight factor to use to account for the fact that larger galaxies are
preferentially excluded from this catalog due to the proximity to CCD edges.
(Currently all weights are set to 1.0).

GAL_FILENAME: Name of the file containing the galaxy image.  This is just a
filename, not including a full path.

PSF_FILENAME: Name of the file containing the PSF image for this galaxy.
This is just a filename, not including a full path.

GAL_HDU: HDU containing the image of this galaxy in the file called GAL_FILENAME.

PSF_HDU: HDU containing the image of the PSF for this galaxy in the file called PSF_FILENAME.

PIXEL_SCALE: pixel scale for the galaxy and PSF images in arcsec (0.03 for all bands).

NOISE_MEAN: mean value of the pixels in the image that do not contain the galaxy.

NOISE_VARIANCE: variance of the pixel values for pixels in the image that do not contain the galaxy.


(2) The files containing galaxy and PSF images are
AEGIS_galaxy_images_[VI]_25.2_n?.fits. The number that goes in place of the "?"
ranges from 0 to 29.


(3) *Parametric fits have not been performed and the values in the table were manually set.*
A catalog containing information about the fits to the galaxies in
AEGIS_galaxy_catalog_[VI]_25.2.fits, using the fitting code from Lackner &
Gunn (2012, MNRAS, 421, 2277) as described in the GREAT3 challenge handbook.
The catalog of fit information is AEGIS_galaxy_catalog_I(V)_25.2_fits.fits
(a FITS table), and the entries are in the same order as in
AEGIS_galaxy_catalog_I(V)_25.2.fits.  The instructions below tell how to use
the entries in this file to construct galaxy images; however, if you use the
COSMOSCatalog class, GalSim will take care of these details for you.  The file
contains the following fields:

IDENT: AEGIS identifier.

MAG_AUTO: magnitude (MAG_AUTO computed by SExtractor).

FLUX_RADIUS: half-light radius for the PSF-convolved object (same as flux_radius from the AEGIS
    catalog), in units of pixels.

ZPHOT: Photometric redshift from the DEEP2 galaxy redshift catalog Data Realase 4 (Newman et al.
    2003).

SERSICFIT: Not used.

BULGEFIT: Not used.

FIT_STATUS: Not used.

FIT_MAD_S: Not used.

FIT_MAD_B: Not used.

FIT_DVC_BTT: Not used.

USE_BULGEFIT: Not used.

VIABLE_SERSIC: Not used.

HLR: Not used.

FLUX: Not used.


(4) Files (AEGIS_galaxy_catalog_[VI]_25.2_selection.fits) with some selection
flags that the GalSim COSMOSCatalog class may use to impose selection criteria
on the quality of the postage stamps and/or fits.


(5) Files acs_[VI]_unrot_sci_20_cf.fits containing information that GalSim
needs to understand the noise fields in the postage stamps.
